# Alien Invasion
Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game developed in Python using the Pygame library.  

The player's mission is to defend humanity's last planet from waves of incoming aliens using a spaceship equipped with bullets while dodging the alien fleet.  

# Story
In the year 2498, an anonymous group of engineers developed the trans-warp technology, ushering humanity into its Golden Age of Space Exploration for the next five millennia.  

We settled across the Milky Way galaxy. With an abundance of all material resources, wars, famine and tyranny became relics of a distant past. Everyone was free to move to other planets and choose their own way of life.  

However, with material scarcity gone, so was our drive to innovate. Comfort bred complacency.

Little did we know... a group of religious settlers ventured beyond the limits of our galaxy and into the Andromeda Galaxy. They encountered an advanced alien civilization so unlike ours - the Zytherion.
While we in the Milky Way enjoyed the Golden Age, the religious settlers had to fight off military invasions and genocide attempts by the Zythers.  

Miraculously, they survived, thrived and triumphed over the Zytherion, who were reduced to domestication by a mind virus created by the religious settlers.  

To achieve such victory, the settlers had to genetically engineer themselves. What they lost in their humanity, they gained in religious zeal, ruthlessness and intelligence. They evolved into humanity's successor species.  

At the turn of the 9th milennia, following their ancient prophecy, the religious settlers returned to reclaim the Milky Way from their ancestral species. Unguarded, our outposts were quickly wiped out. We lost our Paradise.  

Only Earth, our birthplace, still stands, and it's now yours defend.
